    <h2> Steps to make the lasagna</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C)
        <li>Cook the noodles (if not using oven-ready):</li>

        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>

        <li>Boil lasagna noodles until al dente (about 8–10 minutes), then drain and set aside.</li>

        <li>Prepare the meat sauce:</li>

        <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat.</li>

        <li>Add chopped onion and cook until soft.</li>

        <li>Add garlic and sauté for 1 minute.</li>

        <li>Add ground beef (or sausage), breaking it up as it cooks. Cook until browned.</li>

        <li>Drain excess grease if needed.</li>

        <li>Stir in marinara sauce and simmer for 5–10 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning.</li>

        <li>Mix the cheese filling:</li>

        <li>In a medium bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, 1/4 cup of Parmesan, and a pinch of salt. Mix until smooth.
        </li>

        <li>Assemble the lasagna:</li>

        <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>

        <li>Place 3 noodles over the sauce.</li>

        <li>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta mixture over the noodles.</li>

        <li>Sprinkle with mozzarella.</li>

        <li>Repeat layers (sauce → noodles → ricotta → mozzarella) two more times.</li>

        <li>Finish with remaining meat sauce and a generous layer of mozzarella and Parmesan on top.</li>

        <li>Bake:</li>

        <li>Cover the dish with foil (lightly tented so it doesn’t touch the cheese).</li>

        <li>Bake for 25 minutes, then remove foil.</li>

        <li>Bake uncovered for an additional 15–20 minutes, or until the top is bubbly and golden.</li>

        <li>Rest:</li>

        <li>Let the lasagna cool for 10–15 minutes before slicing. This helps it set up and makes serving easier.</li>

        <li>Serve and enjoy:</li>

        <li>Garnish with fresh parsley or basil if desired.</li>

        <li>Serve with garlic bread or a green salad for a full meal!</li>
